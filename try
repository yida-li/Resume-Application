perhaps a digital, virtual, another form of physical data meant for myself, just like a notebook.   Another idea in mind: online journal/dream to share



i felt sickened, what am i like this? why do i succomb to the lowest form of pleasures? why am i so dependant.
there's 1 million more events i can recall and contemplate in restrospect, thousands of voices and memories i should remember
but only 1 in my mind right now. you're stronger than this, keep going and keep on fighting forever
